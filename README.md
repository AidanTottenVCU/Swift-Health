WHAT IS SWIFT-HEALTH?

This project’s overall view is to help physicians and providers have the ability to view and manage patients’ data to help further diagnosis. This software will collect various data such as blood pressure, heart rate, blood oxygen, and more. It will graph and interpret data that will highlight abnormalities. The physician will be able to access data for each patient as well as alert the patient. The provider will also be able to edit a status that displays either normal, abnormal, a final diagnosis, or the need for further testing. This software will help physicians and medical professionals have an organized overall view of a patient’s symptoms.
